In this project based on p5js I seek to expose the location of the bicycle counters in the city of Montreal. For the reader, I am directly using information from the City of Montreal API, which means this map is automatically updated according to changes made in the database.

Another important element is that it is possible to download this code and make modifications to integrate a custom map in mapbox with the respective key/token. The lines of code are described in the compteur.js file.

Finally the info boxes can contain more information, I just wanted to verify that there is a possibility to extract information directly from the database.
